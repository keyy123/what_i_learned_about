# Purpose

To create a virtual notebook that allows me to practice a skill as many times as I would like by drilling certain parts or have the ability to provide feedback based on solutions and incorporate it within my own study system. I struggle most with getting the practice in so the focus of this repo is to get as many repetitions as possible learning a certain development related skill meaning the focus will be more towards doing things rather than knowing what something is and when to use it. 


### How to sequence branches in repo to be good notebook 

1. Make a new directory for each resource (books/tutorials/courses/workshops) within the appropriate directory. (i.e If learning Closures in JS place within JS directory)

2. Always start with a branch called `start` for a new repo and make another called do_[directory_name]. It will serve as a final exercise to enforce how well you know a skill.

3. For each step for a specific resource create a new branch named after the step. More specifically, Create the branch of the first step, switch into the branch you just created, and add the source code for the first step then repeat 

- When you create a new branch make a second branch called *do_[branchname]* (nav_styles => do_nav_styles), it should leave the source code from prior steps allowing you to focus on a specific subset of the entire skill for better practice

4. Set a schedule to revisit drills from time to time so you don't get too rusty. 

5. Have some fun. Life is too short to be mad that you forgot an algo. If you are feeling upset or tired go to sleep, go outside, call a friend or family member and talk, make weekend plans, go out to the movies but just relax and have some fun.


NOTE: Change of plans, I do not want to handle the nightmare of subdirectories in Git so I will just add link to repos but the the notes above still apply to those individual repos that will be aggregated in this Github branch
